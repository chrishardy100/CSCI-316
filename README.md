# CSCI-316
 A collection of my projects from my Principles of Pragramming Languages course.
 Project1 #1 parses a given text file and outputs its content to another text file.
 Project #2 builds on the first project to build a lexical analyzer that can recognize basic symbols and tokens and classify them.
